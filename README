Exercises in artificial intelligence hacking.  These are my own toy
implementations of AI smash hits from the 70s, 80s and 90s, which I am
developing for educational purposes.

These are intended to be simple and clear, not efficient or complete!
I intent to study the relationship between the various techniques by
sharing code between the algorithms.

Status: work in progress, not currently in a useful state
