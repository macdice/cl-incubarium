Exercises in artificial intelligence hacking.  These are my own toy
implementations of AI smash hits from the 70s, 80s and 90s, which I am
developing for educational purposes.

These are intended to be simple and clear, not efficient or complete!
I intend to study the relationship between the various techniques by
sharing code between the algorithms... so genetic-programming.lisp and
grammatical-evolution.lisp reuse algorithms from
genetic-algorithm.lisp.
